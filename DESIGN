Components have Ports
Components are passed inputs that are Ports of other components

A Port contains a list of connected components

Components have a delay for passing from input to output.

Component.simulate is called on a component whose input has just changed
  it returns a Delta object which contains a delta time and a list of ports that
  should be considered changed after this delta time

Simulation:
  A list of Delta objects is maintained.
  The list is sorted by Delta.time
  The smallest Delta is eliminated:
    its time interval is subtracted from the other Delta objects
    its ports are used to list all affected components
    each affected component is simulate()-ed
    the resulting Deltas are merged with the Delta list

Target usage example:
  imem = IMem()
  regfile = RegisterFile(read1 = imem.instruction(21, 25), ...)
